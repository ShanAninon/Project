				<h1>Definition</h1>
				<p> Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals, especially in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.</p>
				<h1>History</h1>
				<p>Across history, technological advancements have propelled human civilization forward. From the Paleolithic era's innovations in stone tools and fire use to the Neolithic Revolution's agricultural and metallurgical leaps, humans constantly adapted and progressed. Ancient civilizations pioneered energy use and infrastructure, leading to advancements in transportation, sanitation, and societal structures.

Technological progress persisted through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, fostering intellectual growth and innovation. The Industrial Revolution, driven by steam power, brought about mass production and complex systems. The 20th century witnessed unprecedented leaps in electricity, communication, computing, space exploration, and medicine, transforming society and necessitating specialized education and fields.

Throughout millennia, technological innovation has been a catalyst for societal evolution, fundamentally shaping the way humans live, work, and interact.</p>
